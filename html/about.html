            <h2>A brief presentation</h2>
            <p>Hello there, thank you for coming</p>
            <p>I am an intensely curious individual with a wide breath and depth
                of experiences and aptitudes.
                I like to think of myself as a versatile and multi talented person.
                As a career changer I have a background in accounting and management.
                As an administrator I have been fortunate enough to benefit from the high esteem of clients, 
                coworkers and employers alike.   

            </p>
            <p>
                I was initially motivated to swich to web developement out of sheer curiosity.
                I have always been driven by the intelectual challenge and found myself in 
                need of a change and to set out in search of new professional horizons.
                I discovered the multiplying power of web developement and became fascinated 
                by the intricacies of code. The final motivation for me to take the leap was 
                that I found it aligned nicely with what I consider my life purpose:
                To creat useful and beatiful things that I can share with the most people possible.
                
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a conscientious and reliable person. Besides being naturally a good communicator
                and team player I have also formal training on how to support others to accomplish 
                their goals and align activity with pourpose to live a fullfilling life.
            </p>
            <p>
                But don't just take it from me! I invite you to take a look at my resume 
                and to contact me if you feel this resounds and that we could collaborate fuitfully.
